# High Availability

## Overview

High availability ensures systems remain operational despite failures. It's achieved through redundancy, failover, and health monitoring.

## 🎯 Strategies

### 1. Redundancy
- Multiple instances
- Geographic distribution
- Backup systems

### 2. Failover
- Automatic failover
- Health checks
- Load balancing

### 3. Health Monitoring
- Continuous health checks
- Early failure detection
- Automatic recovery

## ✅ Best Practices

1. **Multiple instances** - avoid single points of failure
2. **Health checks** - monitor continuously
3. **Automatic failover** - quick recovery
4. **Test failures** - chaos engineering
5. **Document procedures** - runbooks
