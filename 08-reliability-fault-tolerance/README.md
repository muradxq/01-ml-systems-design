# 🛡️ Reliability & Fault Tolerance

## Overview

Reliability and fault tolerance ensure ML systems continue operating despite failures. This is critical for production systems.

## 🔑 Key Principles

1. **Design for failure** - assume failures will happen
2. **Redundancy** - multiple instances, backups
3. **Graceful degradation** - fallback mechanisms
4. **Quick recovery** - fast failure detection and recovery
5. **Test failures** - chaos engineering
