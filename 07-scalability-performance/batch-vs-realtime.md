# Batch vs Real-time

## Overview

Choosing between batch and real-time processing depends on latency requirements, data volume, and use cases.

---

## 📊 Comparison

| Aspect | Batch | Real-time |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Latency** | Minutes to hours | Milliseconds |
| **Throughput** | High | Medium |
| **Cost** | Lower | Higher |
| **Complexity** | Lower | Higher |
| **Use Cases** | Analytics, reports | User-facing, interactive |

## ✅ Best Practices

1. **Choose based on requirements** - latency needs
2. **Use hybrid** - batch + real-time
3. **Optimize each** - different optimizations
4. **Monitor both** - track performance
5. **Plan migration** - batch to real-time if needed
