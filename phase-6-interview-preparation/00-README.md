## How to Use This Phase

1. **Start with the framework** -- learn the CLEAR method so you have a consistent structure
2. **Study your target company** -- Meta and Google have different emphases
3. **Review common mistakes** -- know what NOT to do
4. **Practice estimation** -- be comfortable with back-of-envelope math
5. **Design systems from the question bank** -- do them cold before reading the answers
6. **Study the walkthroughs** -- see what strong performance looks like
